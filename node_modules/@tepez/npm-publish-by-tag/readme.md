# npm-publish-by-tag
> Script for publishing to NPM based on tagged git commit

## Usage

1. Update the version in the `package.json` file and commit the change.
1. Tag the commit with a semver version.
1. Push changes, with the tags

1. On the CI server:

```
npm install @tepez/npm-publish-by-tag@latest
node node_modules/@tepez/npm-publish-by-tag
```

## Notes
* This tool should be used with [npm update](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/update) or an alternative such as [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np).

If you use np, make sure to include the `--no-publish` flag since the publishing is going to be done from the CI server.

For instance, this package uses np when calling `npm run update`.

* Initial publish to NPM has to be done manually.
